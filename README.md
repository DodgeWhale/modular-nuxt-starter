# Modular Nuxt Starter

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Or, if there are dependency conflicts:

```bash
npm install --force
```

## Development

Start the development server on <http://localhost:3000> (PORT .env variable).

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

Run the tests and view coverage (V8 by default) using Vitest.

```bash
npm run test
npm run coverage
```

Run the end-to-end tests using Playwright (ensure server is running beforehand).

```bash
npm run e2e
```
